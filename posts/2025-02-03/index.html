        <p>I've wanted to share a couple projects from the end of last year that haven't really had a home. The brevity of these one-off commissions lets me try out ideas without the pressure of needing anything to stick to the wall. I get the feeling of ripping a page out of my notebook and sending it out to float away. With some distance it's enjoyable to look back and notice how my thinking changes, slowly.</p>
<h1>1. Smack Mellon winter party invitation</h1>
<p>This first prompt was pretty standard — a benefit invitation for a non-profit art space. There wasn't a lot to go on conceptually, but the party did coincide with the opening of a <a href="https://www.smackmellon.org/exhibition/carmen-amengual-a-non-coincidental-mirror">new exhibition</a> so I did a bit of research on the artist to see what I could pull together.</p>

<em>Images I saved from Carmen Amengual's instagram page.</em></p>
<p>For whatever reason (my recent turn towards luddite tendencies) I am increasingly turned off by completely digital work. I like the idea of the presence of the hand where it doesn't quite fit. For a long time now I've worked with Illustrator's image trace feature, vectorizing the hell out of scanned drawings to produce something that is <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/a-secret-third-thing">neither hand nor not-hand</a>. So I set to work drawing a page of circles in pencil that very vaguely referenced a photo of a cement architectural motif.</p>

<em>This took me much longer than I care to admit.</em></p>
<p>From there I was on auto-pilot, creating a high contrast black and white edit of my scan and running it through my beloved image trace presets.</p>

<p>I used a portion of the vector results as a structural base to guide the typographic</p>
<p>The final composition</p>

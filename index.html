        <p>When I first started working on this blog’s design I thought about building in a script that would automatically insert a blank post at the start of every day. That way, if I didn’t post, the website would fill up with blank lines. I hoped it might encourage regular posting to keep the lines from piling up. Now that my blog has been live for almost two months I feel stressed about how little I am able to keep up with daily or even weekly publishing. Even though I decided the blanks feature would be too cruel and stressful, I still feel the phantom presence of the lines and how many empty days keep going by.</p>
<p>To get out from under the clock pressure, I had the thought to remove the dates from these entries entirely. And actually I’ve been thinking about my practice of excessively adding dates, and sometimes even timestamps, to everything written in my life in general. I’m no longer convinced that it matters to so diligently keep track of time and I wonder if things appearing in chronological order is enough of a structure, or could even link disparate ideas into a single stream.</p>
<p>My issue with undated entries is that I like having permalinks and I like the permalinks to be a dynamic variable. Not every post has a title so the date becomes a fallback title. I guess I have to admit that my use of dates is purely aesthetic for the “data look” and that’s enough of a reason to keep using them? I’m coming to terms with it.</p>
<p>After typing all this out, now I want to implement the blanks script after all lol.</p>

          <h1 class="title">Acoustic design</h1>
        
        <p>I’ve wanted to share a couple projects from the end of last year that haven’t really found a home in my archive. Well, I took down my portfolio website so maybe I mean I’m trying to establish a new kind of documentation for my work. I like explaining the steps I took to make something as a reminder to myself that there was something worth doing in the process even if the final object is just a jpeg. I use drawing more and more in my design. I like the way I can apply typographic rules to something that doesn't really fit into that system of thought. In the case of the following two projects, its feels like I turned a corner and am ready to let go of an old method so I wanted to make a note of where it happened.</p>
<h2>1. Smack Mellon, Winter Party invitation</h2>
<p>I was hired to make a benefit invitation for a non-profit art space. There wasn’t a lot to go on conceptually, but the party did coincide with the opening of a <a href="https://www.smackmellon.org/exhibition/carmen-amengual-a-non-coincidental-mirror">new exhibition</a> so I did a bit of research on the artist to see what I could pull together.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/6Pe23hN5Zt-1232.jpeg" alt="research" width="1232" height="770">
<em>Images I saved from Carmen Amengual’s instagram page.</em></p>
<p>For whatever reason (Luddism) I am increasingly turned off by completely digital work. I like the idea of the presence of the hand where it doesn’t quite fit. For a long time now I’ve worked with Illustrator’s image trace tool, vectorizing scanned drawings to produce something that is <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/a-secret-third-thing">neither hand nor not-hand</a>. So I set to work drawing a page of circles in pencil that very vaguely referenced a photo of a cement architectural motif.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/XUzLowRmhl-1232.jpeg" alt="pencil drawing of circles" width="1232" height="1546">
<em>This took me much longer than I care to admit.</em></p>
<p>I ran through what I usually do. Scan the drawing, create a high contrast black and white edit, and apply my image trace presets.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/qkGDkv7blY-1232.png" alt="image trace" width="1232" height="754">
<em>Left: grayscale jpeg, right: vector result.</em></p>
<p>I used a portion of the vector results as a structural blueprint for the typographic layer. Some things align perfectly and some don’t. I would say it’s more of a spiritual logic than one that’s absolute.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/vmqoXE6_w9-1200.png" alt="final invitation" width="1200" height="1463">
<em>The final invitation.</em></p>
<p>In the end this was a quick one-off that went into an email. Not very important to me or to the people who received it. I guess that’s why I feel the urge to commemorate it here.</p>
<h2>2. Wilks Group, <em>A Flat Suite</em> album art</h2>
<p>My friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wilksllc">Zack</a> asked if I wanted to work on the album art for their upcoming album and I don’t think I’ve ever worked on a music release before so I was excited for the opportunity. <a href="https://wilksgroup.bandcamp.com/album/a-flat-suite">The songs</a> are mostly acoustic arrangements and so it made sense to me to make this another drawing project. Drawing is acoustic design?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/22REg8Qx-A-1232.jpeg" alt="A Flat Suit sketch" width="1232" height="1506">
<em>My first attempt to scan the ”A Flat Suite” drawing captured the Smack Mellon invitation sketch underneath. Funny.</em></p>
<p>I had this idea to depict flatness in the text. I wasn't sure how I would render it in the final version, but I started with this drawing of the letters in one-point perspective, thinking that the “shadow” of the reversed letters would spell the title in the correct orientation. From there, honestly I got stuck so I made a page of nothing doodles a few weeks later to clear the cobwebs.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/2u3SFGDH5N-1232.jpeg" alt="more sketches" width="1232" height="1528">
<em>I had just gotten a stencil in the mail for entirely different reasons.</em></p>
<p>My next step would normally be to image trace and start playing around with all the parts, but this time it felt wrong - or at least boring. Especially so soon after finishing a project using the same process. It dawned on me that I could work with the raw drawings as primary elements. Something I had weirdly never considered before.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/WHc-MhgSrU-1232.jpeg" alt="early draft" width="1232" height="1232">
<em>Struggling with including digital type.</em></p>
<p>In my sketches, I was getting sick of digital type feeling like an isolated layer on top of a drawn background. No combination felt incorporated or of the same world. Album art is forgiving in that it doesn’t need to have legible text, or any text at all. Collage felt like a refreshing way to think about things. I came up with new rules about how images could have baselines and align to the grid. I did my best to arrange the drawings as if they were letters.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/IdHVAT11gL-1232.png" alt="final A Flat Suite album art" width="1232" height="1232">
<em>The final album art. Type it with pencil.</em></p>
<p>I’m happy to have unstuck myself in this way. I can’t promise that I’ll never use image trace again. The lesson here for me is less about vector vs. raw and more about creating a cohesive visual language that better integrates the hand with the not-hand. At the very least it feels nice to have done something differently.</p>

        <p>Some forms of representation are truer than others. A photo isn’t always the best download. The brain is an imperfect hard-drive. Writing can save a picture of a thought. I’m excited about all kinds of pictures. Essentially I’m excited about light. The best camera is the one you have with you (AKA YOUR EYES).</p>

        <p>I texted <a href="http://instagram.com/gordons_implicit_dogma">Gordon</a> that my blog was nearly done and ready for my first post. He wrote back: “what shall fill this hallowed space” (including the quotation marks). That made me laugh. It also made me think about how having a blog is bound to be a little embarrassing. Still... this is what I want my website to be.</p>
<p>I’m used to launching projects with a predetermined, if not overdetermined, system for both the front and back end’s design. This can lead to a website that looks impressive but may not actually be very useful or usable. It can quickly become a dead end. The ideal time to design a website would be after it’s over, not before it begins.</p>
<h2>Websites have no end</h2>
<p>For this latest iteration of my personal space on the web, my intention is to forego anticipation and launch with a design for an empty website because websites are born empty. I’m going to allow content to take the lead and this container will grow more specific as I go.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/w3bXP7u8FY-1232.jpeg" alt="Photo of computer screen showing Cdxs.ist on the day of launch" width="1232" height="924">
<em>Documentation of how this page appears at the time of publishing. I will probably make posts (or a changelog) to keep track of design updates because I’m a nerd and I need a place to talk about that kind of thing.</em></p>
<p>I tried my best to stay completely structureless but in the end I am a graphic designer, so my one concession was to include dates on each post. These punctuate a timeline and provide practical permalinks to single post pages. I feel comfortable allowing this single necessity to start. Everything else I will address as it comes.</p>
<h2>What shall fill this hallowed space</h2>
<p>Besides simply being a project for me to fixate on, I have a few ideas about what this website is for.</p>
<ul>
<li>To practice writing</li>
<li>To remember things I find interesting</li>
<li>To document my work in realtime</li>
<li>To build a website that is continuously in development</li>
</ul>
<h2>Production notes</h2>
<p>This website is built on <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">Eleventy</a> and hosted in a <a href="https://github.com/cdx5/cdx5.github.io">Github repository</a>. (Pipe dream to learn how to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted">self-host</a> some day.) To write this post I organized my thoughts in <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> and eventually landed on handwriting a draft on my <a href="https://supernote.com">Supernote</a>.</p>

<em>Obsessed with this Staedtler <a href="https://www.staedtler.com/us/en/discover/noris-digital">EMR stylus</a>.</em></p>
<p>To publish, everything is typed into a markdown file in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VS Code</a> and pushed live via git command line. I’m using peaceiris’s <a href="https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages">Github Pages Action</a> to run the build remotely and deploy the static site to the branch that this link points to. I figured much of this out thanks to this <a href="https://quinndombrowski.com/blog/2022/05/07/hosting-eleventy-on-github-pages">blog post</a> by Quinn Dombrowski.</p>
<p>Most of the work that went into this project has to do with the process behind the scenes (agonizing over folder structures and automatic image optimization). Everything has been set up to reduce barriers to posting. My hope is for the result to feel like a public notebook.</p>
<p>I have to thank <a href="https://laurelschwulst.com">Laurel</a> for introducing me to Eleventy and for being an excellent sounding board throughout the development process. Much gratitude is also due to my partner <a href="https://www.elizaveta.biz">Elizaveta</a> for listening to me say the word “blog” many, many times and still loving me.</p>
